##  Features

-  **Voice Command Support**  
  Control your Arduino hands-free using built-in speech recognition (Web Speech API).

-  **Stylish Button Controls**  
  Visually enhanced buttons provide an intuitive alternative to voice commands.

-  **Serial Communication over USB**  
  Communicates directly with your Arduino using the Web Serial API.

-  **Sensor Interactions**  
  Supports temperature readings and custom serial messages from Arduino.

-  **User-Centric UI**  
  Floating descriptions, modern layout, and optional control modes to enhance usability.
