# Talk2Arduino
Talk2Arduino is a browser-based interface that enables seamless control of an Arduino board via USB, using both speech recognition and interactive buttons. Designed with simplicity and creativity in mind, this project bridges the gap between hardware and modern web technologies â€” no Wi-Fi module required.
