# 🔌 Talk2Arduino – Voice & Button Based USB Control Interface

**Talk2Arduino** is a browser-based interface that enables seamless control of an Arduino board via USB, using both **speech recognition** and **interactive buttons**. Designed with simplicity and creativity in mind, this project bridges the gap between hardware and modern web technologies — no Wi-Fi module required.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎤 **Voice Command Support**  
  Control your Arduino hands-free using built-in speech recognition (Web Speech API).

- 🖱️ **Stylish Button Controls**  
  Visually enhanced buttons provide an intuitive alternative to voice commands.

- 🔌 **Serial Communication over USB**  
  Communicates directly with your Arduino using the Web Serial API.

- 🌡️ **Sensor Interactions**  
  Supports temperature readings and custom serial messages from Arduino.

- 🧠 **User-Centric UI**  
  Floating descriptions, modern layout, and optional control modes to enhance usability.
